about=Polygon Divider takes a polygon and efficiently divides it into a number of 'squareish' polygons of a defined size, which is useful for a multitude of applications such as land parceling, environmental sampling, and so on.<br/><br/>Each output polygon inherits all of the attributes from its parent, as well as a number of additional attributes (id, uuid, area, representative point coordinates) that are described in the repository along with some usage examples.
